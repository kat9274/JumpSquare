# JumpSquare

#GamePlay:
-Jump onto platforms
-Avoid obstacles
-Randomly generated platforms
-Boosts that make you go 100 up
-3 lives

#Visuals:
-Platforms change color the higher you go
-Obstacles are either bullets, lazers or spikes
-Lives represented by people following youu

#Controls (Ideas):
-If the mouse is on one side of the screen go to that side.
-Launcher style controls (hold mouse to jump in that direction) duration of mouse hold affects jump height
-Timing method (bar that has a slider and when you click it goes in the direction of the side that the slider is on)

#Other Ideas:
-How to get the player to go fast: make the screen dim when you are going slow and if it goes entirely to black "go to sleep" and make them loose
-The higher you get the slower you go
-If you use launcher style controls maybe make the platforms slippery
